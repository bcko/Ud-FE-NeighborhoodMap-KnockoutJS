## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
- Add unique functionality beyond the minimum requirements (i.e. the ability to “favorite” a location, etc.).
- Incorporate a build process allowing for production quality, minified code, to be delivered to the client.
- Data persists when the app is closed and reopened, either through localStorage or an external database (e.g. Firebase).
- Include additional third-party data sources beyond the minimum required.
- Style different markers in different (and functionally-useful) ways, depending on the data set.
- Implement additional optimizations that improve the performance and user experience of the filter functionality (keyboard shortcuts, autocomplete functionality, filtering of multiple fields, etc).
- Integrate all application components into a cohesive and enjoyable user experience.
